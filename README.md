 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @apserika

 I have solid knowledge and practical experience in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. As a programmer, I master these three essential technologies for web development. Here is a summary of my knowledge and experiences in each of them:

JavaScript:

I have a broad knowledge of JavaScript, a versatile and powerful programming language.
I have experience in dealing with fundamental concepts, such as variables, conditionals, loops and functions.
I am familiar with the JavaScript object model, including the use of prototypes and inheritance.
I am able to work with events, DOM manipulation and asynchronous execution using Promises and Async/Await.
I have knowledge in popular libraries and frameworks, such as jQuery, React and Angular, which allow me to develop interactive and dynamic web applications.
HTML:

I have extensive knowledge of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the markup language used to structure the content of web pages.
I am able to create semantic and accessible structures using the correct HTML tags.
I have experience working with HTML forms, including validating input data and submitting data to servers.
I am familiar with creating multimedia elements such as images, videos and audios using HTML.
css:

I have a good knowledge of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the style language used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements.
I am able to apply styles and formatting to web pages, including colors, fonts, sizes, margins and positioning.
I am familiar with responsive layout and adaptive design techniques, allowing to create user-friendly interfaces on different devices.
I have knowledge in CSS preprocessors, such as Sass and Less, which help me to write more modular and reusable CSS code.
Overall, my experience in JavaScript, HTML and CSS allows me to create dynamic, interactive and aesthetically pleasing websites. I am always up to date with the best practices and market trends, constantly seeking to improve my skills in these areas.

Young in the programming area, I leave here my social media profiles and repository so you can check my projects and skills.
